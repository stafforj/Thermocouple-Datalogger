# Build Instructions and Notes

### Operating Principles

The core components in the build are the relay and microcontroller. The relay on the control board is an electromagnetic switch. Sending 5VDC to the relay energises the internal coil, mechanically switching its state from Normally-Open (NO) to a closed circuit $^*$. This process is automated using a programmable microcontroller which sends a 5VDC signal to the relay at specific times. All the circuitry has been placed within an enclosure to prevent access to the high AC voltages involved.

$^*$ _Note that the relay used in this build can also be wired for a Normally-Closed state if required (with lower current limits of 10A)._

## Modifications

The only modification required is to the DIN enclosure. This is to provide cooling to the electronics, particularly if the relay is controlling a high current load (~ 10-20A) for long periods (> 2 mins) at a time. Holes were drilled on either side of the enclosure to allow air to pass through and across the relay board. The choice of perforated walls with small (~ 3 - 5mm diameter) holes allows air to flow through while preventing the risk of users contacting the AC circuit inside the box. A miniature axial fan (30mm x 30mm x 7mm, $Q_{max} = 3.7$ CFM) was mounted to the inside of the enclosure with the outlet against the perforated enclosure wall. To prevent hot air leaking back into the enclosure at the fan outlet, masking tape (the blue coloured tape in the images) was placed around the fan housing and against the enclosure wall. The fan operates in "pull-mode" in this arrangement, drawing in cool external air that heats up and is then expelled from the outlet. Two large holes (~ 12 mm) were also driled in each side of the enclosure to facilitate the routing of the AC cable.

## Wiring

### Relay to Arduino

The relay control board requires +5VDC, GND and a signal (4-6VDC) to actuate the switch. The +5VDC and GND are connected to the pins of the Ardunio using yellow and orange cables in the image below. Pin 13 of the Arduino is connected to the signal pin of the relay control board (green cable) and used to deliver a 5VDC signal for actuating the switch.

### AC supply to Relay

The three wires from the AC cable (live - brown, neutral - blue, GND - yellow/green) are routed through the enclosure. The live wire is connected to the pins of the relay control board and inserted in the NO configuration.

### Cooling fan

The cooling fan operates on 5VDC and 0.36W of power. This results in 72mA of current required from the power supply, which allows for running it directly off the Arduino 5VDC supply pin ($I_{max} \approx 800$ mA). The red (+5VDC) and black (GND) cables from the axial fan are connected to the relay control board pins which take 5VDC and GND off the Arduino UNO. In this arrangement, the fan rotates when the Arduino is powered on (either through the USB or power supply). Although heat is generated discontinuously through the relay action, providing continuous air cooling within the enclosure is preferred for reliable temperature regulation.

## Arduino Code

The arduino code for uploading to the Arduino UNO microcontroller is located in `/Code/relay-switch.ino`. This contains a routine which turns the relay from the default open circuit (Normally-Open) to closed circuit where the outlet plug will be energised with AC from the source (in our case, single-phase 240VAC).

First, the signal pin is set as an output. Here, we use `LED_BUILTIN` as the signal pin which is pin 13 on the Arduino UNO.

```
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}
```

The remainder of the code involves setting up the time intervals and switching duration. These define how long the relay will switch `on` and `off` for (in milliseconds). And the switching duration is expressed by a total ON time `t` which is limited in the for loop to be less than a user-defined value (e.g., `t<1800000`). The relay is actuated by sending pin 13 `HIGH` (5VDC) and returned to NO by sending pin 13 `LOW`. In this example, the AC circuit is energised for 1 minute, turns off for 2 minutes, and will operate for a total ON time of 30 minutes. Once this target duration of 30 mins is reached, the loop exits and the relay returns to the default NO state permanently.   

```
void loop() {
  long on=60000;      
  long off=120000;    

  for (long t=0; t<1800000; t=t+on) {    
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);    
    delay(on);                          
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);     
    delay(off);                         
    Serial.println(""); 
   }
  
  exit(0); 
```
